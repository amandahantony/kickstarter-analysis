# Excel Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns Across the Globe
Performing Excel analysis on Kickstarter campaigns and their data to map trends and produce meaningful conclusions.

## Overview of Project
Louise has created a kickstarter campaign for her play, Fever. In order to decipher trends and draw meaningflul conclusions, she is requiring the help of a data analyst to comb through, analyze and visualize the data of other kickstarter campaigns. In this project, the launch date, goals and outcomes of various theatre/play campaigns were analyzed using pivot tables, charts and excel calculations. 

### Purpose
By using the values and charts obtained through this excel analysis, Louise will be able to understand the outcomes of various campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. As a result, Louise wil be able to draw meaningful conclusions about her own play based on the trends of others. 


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To draw conclusions about theatre outcomes based on launch date, a pivot table (shown below) was created. The pivot table summarizes the count of successful, failed and canceled theatre campaigns based on the month they were launched. The pivot table also includes two filters that allow for easier read of outcomes based on specific parent categories and years. However, for the sake of this project, we have filtered the table to only look at theatre campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A table (shown below) was curated to understand the outcomes of theatre plays based on funding goals. For this analysis, we looked at 12 different goal ranges and the number of plays that were successful, failed or canceled in each range. The COUNTIFS function was used to gather the number of plays that fit into each category.
