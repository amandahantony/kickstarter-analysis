# Excel Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns Across the Globe
Performing Excel analysis on Kickstarter campaigns and their data to map trends and produce meaningful conclusions.

## Overview of Project
Louise has created a kickstarter campaign for her play, Fever. In order to decipher trends and draw meaningflul conclusions, she is requiring the help of a data analyst to comb through, analyze and visualize the data of other kickstarter campaigns. In this project, the launch date, goals and outcomes of various theatre/play campaigns were analyzed using pivot tables, charts and excel calculations. 
### Purpose
Using the values and charts obtained through this excel analysis, Louise will be able to understand the outcomes of various campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. As a result, Louise wil be able to draw meaningful conclusions about her own play based on the trends of others. 


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To draw conclusions about theatre outcomes based on launch date, a pivot table (shown below) was created. The pivot table summarizes the outcome count of successful, failed and canceled theatre campaigns based on the month they were launched. The pivot table also includes two filters that make it easier to read the outcomes based on specific parent categories or years. However, for the sake of this prohect, we have filtered the table to only look at theatre campaigns.
